# Week 14
## Tues
- Significantly better check in for all groups. Great to see these coming together more and more.
- Saw some start into the OpenAPI stuff more than others. There is a great "pet store" example that a few began reverse engineering that I suggest looking for (it's the openapi example the project uses). When basing off that make sure to clean out the pet store stuff but it'll help with getting a valid spec and documenting data needs.
- I'll do a quick review of a word game PR for a coding concept in web components (event + property management) that applies well w/ that game board
  - https://github.com/reyes-edwin/word-guessing-game/pull/3
- Read through the feedback or code that I submitted back to you and keep cranking through
- Anything you get done in class today that you'd like targetted feedback on, please DM me between now and Wed and I'll review for Thurs
