# Week 4/5 - Putting concepts into practice to build a NASA image viewer

## Tues
- From reading through it seems most understood the fundamentals of the requests we were making and how to wire up to a wikipedia-query tag
  - Several ran into issues w/ rate limitting, a topic we'll need to build a solution for in the future via API keys
  - the codepen has a magic script in it (we call it that, literally) which references a `build.js` file and loads off a registry. It is not to be included in the code of your element. Copy paste slightly less. ðŸ¤”
  - `fetch` and this feedback loop of small thing + API is the act of building a micro-frontend
- Today I'll be stepping through how the following works to form a basis for what your going to do the next 2 weeks: https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project/blob/master/src/CourseDates.js
  - Fun hidden gem for later: The gh pages site for https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project automatically builds with this demo :)
  - We'll touch on this in a future week (but yours are all wired up to auto-build too if built correctly... ðŸ‘ˆ)
- I'm going to take a data model that someone in class produced (`response.json`) and wire it up to a `date-card` webcomponent that an IST student made for us at a previous point in time - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lrnwebcomponents/date-card
  - `@lrnwebcomponents/date-card` is available on NPM if you'd like to follow along
- For this exercise, we're going to take a single response from an API, parse it into an Array, *transform the data into something easier to understand* for our element, and then "stamp" the data down using a specialized `for` loop called a `.map`
  - `.map` allows you to walk `Array` data and can be read as "Take each item in this array and do the following thing with each value"
  - `LitElement` has specialized support for `.map` and `properties` that are `type: Array` to automatically update your element when values change, as a loop

- I'll walk through how I wired an existing date-card element up to the data in question:
  - I'll demonstrate how stateful variables can be leveraged in order to trigger functionality in a `LitElement` based element
  - I'll demonstrate wiring up to form input to modify how many results are rendered

## Resources:
  - Read "Rendering Arrays" in the Lit docs - https://lit.dev/docs/templates/lists/#rendering-arrays (stick with the `.map` convention expressed)
  - Another quick one from open-wc (another great resource) - https://open-wc.org/guides/knowledge/lit-element/rendering/
  - Example from playground (check the JS box though) - https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/repeating-and-conditional
  - Lit Conditional rendering: https://lit.dev/docs/templates/conditionals/
  - Mozilla docs are your JS friend - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getMonth

## Lab this week (started today, worked on Thurs / due Sunday):
I want you to leverage an existing asset our team made called `accent-card` in order to render media from space....
> it's not as ridiculous as that just sounded
- Example response / thing to play with -- https://hax.psu.edu Media search
- This week this is a partner project. So pair program with someone, expect to meet up either this weekend or between classes
- In your repo create a new file that will house your new web component and name this element `nasa-image-search` (file name can be anything you want . js)
- This web component should include `lit` as well as the `accent-card` our team built
  - Docs in a "storybook" to play with: https://webcomponents.psu.edu/styleguide/?path=/story/layout-card--accent-card-story
  - You'll see `slot="` as an attribute on here, this allows rendering content into a specific place on the card. Background reading - https://lit.dev/docs/components/shadow-dom/
  - The npm asset is `@lrnwebcomponents/accent-card` install it (from articles I saw many of you missed adding `--save` which is important for version control
- NASA image API docs - https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf
- example usage to show all images related to the moon landing: https://images-api.nasa.gov/search?q=moon%20landing&media_type=image

## Requirements of your element:
- Named `nasa-image-search`
- Leverages `accent-card` and a `.map` to render the following data onto the card inside your element:
  - The image (`image-src=`)
  - the title (`<div slot="heading">`)
  - the description (`<div slot="content">`)
  - Who took the photo (`secondary_creator`, also included with the content area of the card)
- `fetch` data from the NASA image API based on a method being called to request the data (clicking the search button should initiate this)
- Simplify the response data to an object that only has the data needed for rendering
- using a `.map` render this data
- `index.html` / demo page needs to have this capability:
 - A button that initiates the search when `click`'ed and returns results (defaulting to moon landing)
 - **Option 1**: A "search" `input` that accepts text and changes what's searched for by modifying a property called `term` on your element
 - **Option 2**: A "page number" `input` that accepts a number and changes a property called `page` on your element to request a specific page of results
 - **Option 3**: A "Return data only" checkbox that modified a `Boolean` on your element to conditionally render an unordered `ul` list of items (like my date example) but defaults to the `accent-card` by default.

## Note:
- I have removed all the other boilerplate from my current demo for reference; this is not required but made it easier to read in my example
- This is a multi-week project where all **pairs**, pair program in order to generate the 3 options.
- Start working on this now and ask questions so that we can all learn together toward the solution

## Wed
- Get some initial work done on the nasa-image-search so that you can ask questions.
- Post issues / questions into our slack channel **#edtechjoker** so others can see said questions (there are no stupid questions)
- There are office hours w/ our LA today

## Thursday
- Class time is working time and I'll review questions at the start of class if I haven't responded in the channel already
- I will be available to explain code snippets or offer debugging support

## Due Sunday
- **Each pair should submit a link to 1 repo with their best attempt at solving the lab**
- I'll review solutions for notable answers and aspects that are more "correct" than others / on the right track
- I'll provide feedback via slack and in person next week
- This is the 1st part of a 2 part lab
- The 2nd part will be to finish the lab as a group and merging specific aspects of code together, most likely through a shared coding experience with someone driving and others researching / experimenting to find solutions to each of the 3 options
- Lab 4 is due Sunday at midnight. Each pair / Option should submit their solution as work in progress to the **#edtechjoker** channel. This is a "check in" worth 2 points.

### Note
- Lab 5 is taking all 3 options and merging them together into a solution everyone believes to be the best work the group can assemble.
- Lab 5 is worth 6% and has stupid prizes associated with the best / most correct solution(s)

## Week 5 - Refinement and feedback
Ultimately, we'll work toward each group producing 1 solution.

## Tuesday
- I'll provide feedback on a variety of solutions / things to watch for, what worked well, various feedback
- In class activity: Working with your group, review each other's solutions **within your group**. Most will have 3 options to combine / discuss, some will have 2 based on group size.
- As a product of your review / discussion I'd like the following artifact created and submitted (**1 per person**).
- Group dynamics will work as follows: 3 option team. 1 person from Option 1 reviews Option 2's code. 1 person from Option 1 reviews Option 3s code
 - If you only have 2 options in your group then break in 1/2 as best you can, if there's 3 then that's fine to have 2 reviewers on 1 part of produced solution 
 - **Create an issue in your main team project** issue queue (for most this is your-organization/ip-project/issues)
 - In this issue call it something like "feedback on option X" where X is the option you produced feedback for
 - In your feedback I want to see the following headings (written using markdown):
   - What parts worked well or that you found the approach novel and should be incorporated into the final solution for your team
   - What parts could be improved upon. "Nothing it looks great" is not a valid sentiment. Could they provide better commenting / documentation? Are there functions that can be deleted bc the code is unused? Are they monsters and used 4 spaces instead of 2? There's always something either stylistically, documentation or in control logic we can learn from to improve.
   - Next steps: What are the next recommended course of action. If it's going to be the thing that the group uses to base their final solution on, awesome. If it needs improvement, what resources could be used to help improve understanding / fix the issue in question. Provide google results / links to possible resources to make this happen
   - Submit this issue to the edtechjoker channel; this will be used as attendance verification for the day
 - After everyone finishes the in class activity and submits to the channel, then it's time to start digging into crafting 1 solution based on the requirements below. This will bleed over from Tues into Thurs

## Requirements of final element:
- You'll work with your group to produce 1 solution in your main repo for your organization.
  - **protip:** While you COULD merge / PR solutions, I'd recommend manually generating an optimal solution from all 3 options in 1 repo via the manual code review
 - A "search" `input` that accepts text and changes what's searched for by modifying a property called `term` on your element
 - A "page number" `input` that accepts a number and changes a property called `page` on your element to request a specific page of results
 - A "Return data only" checkbox that modified a `Boolean` on your element to conditionally render an unordered `ul` list of items (like my date example) but defaults to the `accent-card` for presenting results.

### New requirements for the element once you get those 3 merged together
- Add support for year_start and year_end in your input form
  -  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local could be used for snagging a date, however the API is just a year so might be `input` better
- Using WAVE plugin and/or Lighthouse, make sure that your form is accessible.
- Get github pages setup for your repo; the code is already there if using `ip-project` as your base, you just need to activate actions for your repo: https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml is what powers the action (which we'll step through).
 - If your code blends while you develop it, it should work as a github action.
 - Make sure to enable github pages within your repo setting
 - I'd recommend delegating the 3 additional requirements across your team based on different roles investigating different pieces
- Anything submitted on Wed via DM (question or hey do you mind reviewing this code..) I'll look at and discuss at the start of class Thursday
## Thursday
- This is primarily a working session to ensure that the requirements for your element are met

## Sunday / submitting the Lab
- 1 Solution per team is to be submitted to Canvas for the Lab 5 Dropbox
- This is worth 6%
- Rubric:
  - Queries NASA and returns results as expected, rendered through the `accent-card` while having support for Options 1,2,3 from week 4 - 3%
  - The additional 3 requirements introduced this week and your site correctly self-rebuilds on commit via github actions 3%
  - Best solution (subjective) +1%
