# Week 10 - Vercel === magic ü™Ñ and setting up for the final project
## Tuesday
- Welcome back!
- I'll be doing a walk through of how the vercel file structure works and what is going on with this demo that has me lit
  - demo: https://ist-vercel-demo-gamma.vercel.app/
  - code: https://github.com/btopro/ist-vercel-demo
  - backend: (cheating... for sure) https://jsonbin.io/
- Guest lecture: edTechJoker üÉè üòï
  - edTechJoker is going to talk about life, the way forward, research, and activism
  - This establishes the final project

## Thursday
- Reading through more of the requirements so we're on the same page
- Thursday to start class, you'll have selected the project you want to work on
- We'll start doing some prototyping in class on paper / tablet / figma / XD / however you prototype things
  - Need to diagram the relationship between front end and back end via box diagrams
  - Need to start to draw the front end, pointing out how different aspects of it are handled visually
  - What does the API look like?
  - What data does the front end have that the back end needs?
  - What information does the back end need to bring to the front end?
- The goal of this initial rough work is to have...
  - the front end team envision what it might look like
  - the back end team envision what calls their might be to power data of the frontend prototype
  - the API team to refine and envision what the call structure for the API looks like
- Ask questions, refine the needs
- Week-end check in
  - Due to limitations in vercel, you'll have to run vercel builds / wire it up to **your personal forks and NOT the organization**
  - A way to side-step this is 1 person hooks Vercel up to their account, everyone else gets writes on their repo and then works within branches or forks off of them
  - A repo in 1 team member's account for the doc site you are going to maintain in 11ty
  - A repo in 1 team member's account for a USE AS TEMPLATE of https://github.com/btopro/ist-vercel-demo renamed to be related to your project
- **Sunday night by Midnight**: Submit to the #edtechjoker channel a link to your working 11ty documentation space with the following in the site
  - a section describing the project / linking to the issue you selected
  - a section linking to your fork of the repo, the repo powering your 11ty site
  - a "Notes" section that says Week 10, and has images of the mock ups, details that you teased out in class Thursdauy, any notes your team generated, as well as questions and next steps
