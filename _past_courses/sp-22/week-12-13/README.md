## Week 12
### Tues / Thurs
- Working days with attendence
- Here's what I'll be looking for / wanting to review for Check-in 3.

### Check in 3 due Sunday by midnight
- API / PM:
  - Document each end point (backend piece) with what it's called (file name), what purpose it serves, what data it requires, what data it returns
- Front end:
  - Some code that begins wiring up to the back end, even if it's in the form of a button that goes and gets data
  - Some visuals / code to start telling me thought has been given to the structure of what the front end is going to look like even structurally
- Back end:
  - 1 endpoint should be developed, even partly
  - All end points should be stubbed out (file named appropriately w/ some comments as to what the purpose is, coordinate w/ the API/PM people on your team for this)

Check in is to have some notes added to your 11ty doc site about what was accomplished with links to code / test spaces. Backend / API / PM people should read / watch the videos in this article -- https://swagger.io/blog/news/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0/ . This check in will touch on starting to document pieces of the API as far as what you'll need in the end to produce a working OpenAPI 3.0 spec document, a standard way of documenting APIs IRL. Here is an example from HAXcms for reference: http://haxcms.herokuapp.com/system/api/openapi/json

We'll step through the open API stuff some next week, it is part of final project requirements to have a valid document of the APIs. This helps with developing a well understood, headless end point for other systems to potentially consume.

**The more code you develop, even with issues, the more feedback I can give. Tues will be stepping through code produced by teams in class. The more code, the more feedback, the faster you can develop solutions, refine them, and ace the final project. The less code now, the harder the road ahead**


## Week 13
### Tues
- Review code produced by teams for check in 3.
- Feedback will be potentially via PR, textual comment, or me walking through how something works in class.
- After review there will be more time to work in class

### Thursday
- Working day in class

### Check in 4 due
Sunday at midnight
- any additional code you want reviewed
- All endpoints must be started
- Front end stub code should be at least attempted
- OpenAPI spec document started
