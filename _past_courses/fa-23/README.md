# IST 256 - FA 2023
Welcome to the "web components are the future that is here right now" course. This course is for advanced Web application development and that could go one of two ways.
1. Industry way. Adopt whatever gets you an app quickly. You understand how nothing works, adopting whatever conventions someone blogs about
2. My way. We learn vanilla and use a very small library just above vanilla called Lit.

Why?
- You'll know what makes up industry tools
- you'll have a broader perspective and still adopt tools but more inline with the right tool for the job (hopefully)
- you'll still learn HTML / CSS / JS but be closer to what their raw capabilities are as opposed to going right to abstraction and being lost
- I use these tools in my own projects, thus making you more able to contribute to them directly
- People taking my courses in the past have instantly gone into dev careers implementing web components because they are becoming a valid industry go to

# I need a book
If that's true. I suggest you read this. https://eloquentjavascript.net/
I won't quiz you on it but it's going to make life a lot more logical as we go through things like event loop and JS logic.
