## Project rubric
- Miss a requirement? auto 1 point off
- Stylistic / unused code / thing to clean up as a developer? -.1 - -1 depending on scale of the issue
- Minor issue like CSS doesn't look correct or has small positioning issue? -.25 - .75 depending on scale of issue
- Accessibility / security / other issue? -.1 - .75 depeending on scale of issue
- We will grade project 3 more harshly than project 2 as we are working toward perfection based on the best looking, functioning code that matches the comps our 'client' requires.

- HAX.psu.edu for context of where this will be used
- issue in question: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1738

- Using https://github.com/btopro/polaris-chip as a foundation will speed up development, though you'll want to rename directories and files

# Week 10 - Project 2 continued
## Tues Critique
- Will start class walking through a few repos to show current state and offer feedback
- I will record this process but please stop me to ask questions as we go

## Wed
- If you think of specific questions / examples of issues you are having, DM me or a TA so that we can discuss Thurs
- Keep working on your element to refine it

## Thurs
- Answering questions that came in / offering additional advisement
- More time to collaborate in class
- If you have yours working, make sure the other people on your team have theirs working. Teaching often refines your knowledge
