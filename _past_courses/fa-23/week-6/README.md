# Week 6 - remediation

## Let's get GENERAL BROAD concepts down here of how to develop with open WC here
![How to class / work with these different projects](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/assets/329735/c110a2de-09c9-4a5d-81bf-9d9d07d3a886)

Some of you are getting it, but we've got a lot of ghosts out there right now. There's a few ways to solve this:
- Office hours with TAs, they know what they are doing and can help
- Office hours, ask me about them if needed
- In class time is a lot of open office hours

## Critique of 3 projects
- https://github.com/VivekUppalapu/my-card -- TS / typescript
- https://github.com/christianwasta/my-card
- https://github.com/Seig1xo/owl-card

## Time in class to work through issues
By the end of this week your card should be (examples shown after, you do your actual open wc card)
- In JavaScript, not typescript
- Code On github - https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms-odl -- Code on github, link to public repo
- Build with a URL that you can review a preview using Vercel with an address similar to https://haxcms-odl-five.vercel.app/
- Buttons working using refactored conventions to work in Web components context

## Wed between class
- Watch this video about making a card via open-wc -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTYv_8EPIo

## Rest of class
- Working in your pod, ask teammates for help, review where people are stuck. If no one in your pod can help and you are really stuck, ask TAs / me for help
- Explaining to some one how something works, helps you refine your understanding / check understanding of how it works

# HW for Week 6
- The above working, turned in on a Gist with links to  your code and your built code working (not a vercel.com.... address, the actual card rendered and working)
- Your Card made in open-wc, published to github with HTML and CSS working, with a website auto-rebuilding with a whatever.vercel.app addresss that you share
- You have taken / reviewed all of the tutorials here - https://lit.dev/tutorials/
- After that, make a best effort attempt at getting the JavaScript to work
- You watched the video above between classes, if not, do so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTYv_8EPIo
- Watch the following to help with week 6 and see ideas for week 7:
