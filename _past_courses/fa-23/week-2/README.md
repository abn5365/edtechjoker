## Homework
Two-part homework this week; we will have time in class Thurs to start and then Tues the focus will be critique via submissions generated by the class.

### HW Part 1
- Fork this pen on codepen https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/gOjGpam
- Try to make more than 1 meme by duplicating the HTML portion of the code
- Modify the text / image used in the meme on the HTML portion
- Try to modify the font-size using the CSS tab.
- Make a new gist where you try to answer the following questions
  - Provide a Link to your fork of the codepen
  - The top of the JS code says `import ....` what is this doing? Is this vanilla?
  - The bottom says `export { MemeMaker };` what do you think this does? Is this vanilla?
  - Look at the constructor() what does this do? Does this remind you of anything?
  - Look at the `render()` method, is this convention "vanilla" (built in) or do you think a library is delivering this?
  - What is `this` throughout the JS? How do you think these values being populated?
  - Look at the CSS / styles; What's special about `--meme-maker-font-size-medium`?
  - Look at @media in styles() what does this do?
  - Can you change the font color? If not, where do you think it is that being set

### Part 2:
- Working with your pod, come up with an agreed upon visual as to how you'd conceive the following problem:
#### We need to make a card with a fancy button on it
- I will model the button on the white board
- I'll use codepen to create the button based on my model
- You are free to follow along and copy or just watch and ingest technique

#### Now it's your turn, kicked up a notch
- Working with your Pod, created a shared model of a card visually based on the requirements below
- model things after the screenshot / pen and paper copy you came up with

#### Required steps:
- Create a new codepen from scratch and try to create a "card" using a mix of semantic, div and other tags to lay the card out:
- Create a simple “card” using a few SECTION or DIV tags, a Heading for the title, a Paragraph for description of the image an IMG for an image, and a button on the card that says "Details" which links to hax.psu.edu
- Make the image a fixed size via height / width and ensure the card is no bigger than 400px wide (height is weird in CSS, ignore height)
- Use the Border, Margin, and padding attributes in order to space the card to visually be appealing (the internet can help influence something to model, try making things 8px and then 12, then 16 to find what you like, ratios are key)
- Add a media query that only shows the details button when the screen is smaller than 800px (generally a small tablet) but larger than 500px (phone)
- Add a media query that scales the card (and image / items within) when on a screen smaller than 500px (generally considered phone)
- Include the link to this codepen in your gist. If you found particular websites helpful from a tutorial perspective on any of these specific requirements, then include them so we can share with the class.

#### Remediation
I will not verify you completing these, but here are 2 low level tutorials from W3Schools for practicing HTML and CSS fundamentals
- https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
- https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/resources -- the resources section of the course site has links to free "books" which cover a lot of fundamentals as well

## Homework Submission
**Submit the link to your gist in Canvas**
The gist should include the following:
- Part 1 and Part 2 codepen links
- any written questions answered
- a picture of the mock up you were trying to model the card off of (can upload to the comments area on a gist via drag and drop)
