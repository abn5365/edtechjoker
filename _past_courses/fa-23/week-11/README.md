# Wed
- Generate questions surrounding scope for project 3

## Thursday
Today in class I'll be walking through how the repo for the project 3 boilerplate works. Here's the trade I just made with you all:

- I increased the requirements of all 3 projects beyond what I originally intended
- I improved the baseline / boilerplate to solve some of the complex issues up-front
- This will be a mix of design and JS state management
- Each of these can be thought of as a "full applicaation"
- You are encouraged to work together
- You still are submitting individually
- You are encouraged to borrow past work from my design system - https://haxapi.vercel.app/
- You are encouraged to borrow past work from this design system - https://shoelace.style/
