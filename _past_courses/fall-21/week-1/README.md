## Tues: Welcome to the course, format, policies, all that jazz
- Short lecture on web components / WHY this topic matters
- Mention Project EdTechJoker and goals of the course for me and them
- Collectivism vs individualism. The collective needs to succeed or your team fails. The individual must succeed or there is never any innovation. Individual must succeed or there is no innovation. individuals ensure we build new rockets; collectives ensure they launch.
- Web components are here to ensure that we can mesh these two concepts together effectively
- Who we are; survey results and imposter syndrome
- What the course is / overall projects
- Questions
- get ahead: install nodejs, npm, git, yarn, VSCode / and IDE on your machine
- Additional helpful tools:
 - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac
 - https://ohmyz.sh/
## Thurs: JS Ecosystem
- Short lecture on the modern web ecosystem
- Activity:
  - Get a partner; this is your pair programmer for the semester
  - Find another pair. This is your team of 4. (one group will be solo and that's ok)
  - All teams must install nodejs, npm, git, yarn, VSCode / IDE and be able to create a open-wc boilerplate
  - If you run into roadblocks we'll work through them together. If your team gets the activity completed, help surrounding teams. We need everyone to be on this page before we can move forward
  - common roadblocks / solutions
   - sudo / user permission issue / common scenario:
 ```bash
# move to YOUR home directory
cd ~
# this makes you a super user to run command; put in your password for the computer
sudo npm install -g yarn
# if there are errors look into running something like this.
# NOT EXACTLY THIS JUST SOMETHING LIKE IT
sudo chmod -R 777 /FULL/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/node_modules
# then run the install command again and see if it fixed it
cd ~
yarn
# if you see no error messages then you are golden
```
## Homework
- If you haven't finished the group activity of getting everything installed; do this on your own time. We all need to get this setup before we can move forward
- Setup account on dev.to / github / join slack channels for project
- Write a blog post introducing yourself, and why you are interested in web development
- Write a blog post on how to get dependencies installed for your machine to teach someone else how to install open-wc
  - Optionally this can be a video tutorial / youtube screencast if desired. It's your preference
