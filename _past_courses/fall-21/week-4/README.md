# Week 4: Project 1: Starting the "OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THIS GOES INTO JUST A button", CTA button
## Tues: Sizing up our own atom
- Buttons are common atoms within an atomic design pattern
- https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/ - resource for what is atomic design
- We could talk about the process for building anything; or, we can start building and start into the project
- This iteration will be a bit "on rails". I'll help frame discussion, considerations, expectations, etc.
- We'll repeat the same feedback loop for a card in a few weeks with less guidance and similar expectations
- Take 5 minutes and search for some possible buttons we can use to have the discussion. CTAs or really any button on any interface (otherwise I'll use Cantvas and no one wants that)
- Group discussion / questions to answer:
  - What are the characteristics of the button?
  - What design considerations must we take into account?
  - What accessibility concerns do we potentially have?
  - What security concerns do we potentially have?
  - What "states" does this button have? What events do we have that correspond with those?
  - What properties do we have?
  - What do we call this?
- Large group discussion with share-outs from these answers
## Thurs: Starting to build the web component
- Create a github repo for this element
- Clone locally.
- Run open-wc to populate repo
- Start to apply the properties, css, html structure
- Mention security consideration
- Mention accessibility implications (color, tabindex)
- Review of the project write up https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/fall-21/projects/p1-button/README.md
- **Project 1 will be due September 30th**
## Homework
- Continue to work on element
- Get code pushed up to github repos
- Submit link to team repo for progress check by Monday at midnight
 - Tues of next week I'll be critiquing code and offering suggestions / feedback for improvement
 - Make sure that you have started on TEAMNOTES.md and what you've discussed / when you've met up.
 - The further your along, even if it's just taking a stab at things, the more robust feedback I'll provide (the better the grade outcomes)
