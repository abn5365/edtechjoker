- Directions / rubric - https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/fall-21/projects/p2-card/README.md

## Thursday
- I'll show your elements all in 1 storybook
- Mention https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package as this wasn't possible without it
- show renaming tags / what the patches do
- Introducing the final project
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5d33apeMrh4LqD3i9QdB7Px - playlist with some tutorials, background of the project
- https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/tree/master/fall-21/projects/p3-haxtheweb - Project requirements
- https://github.com/elmsln/project-3 - Project boilerplate to use as a template (just like last time)

## start in class
- Get the repo setup and workflows in place with your team
- 1 copy for your organization + forks for all contributors
- Pick 2 projects that your team is interested in approaching (1st choice and then a fall back) and claim your primary one in the issue queue (I have to approve)
  - This should be a message like "Team `yourteamnamehere` would like to do this issue"
- TEAMNOTES.md check in 1 should include:
  - What project / issue your picking (link to it)
  - A hand drawn / computer sketch / XD / some annotation visually of what needs to be done or what pieces get broken out. This could be drawn on over top of a screen shot of the item or a photo of whiteboard sketches. Whatever make the most sense to you.
  - Initial questions / unknowns
  - What elements do you expect are needed for this design?
  - What properties do you expect these to have?
  - Slots?
  - What CSS / Styling unknowns are there presently?
  - What states does it have? can you click / hover to engage with it?
  - What properties need mapped to HAX / the storybook? What can the user interact with?

## Homework
Watch the first 3 videos of this play list established for the final project: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5d33apeMrh4LqD3i9QdB7Px
This provides the background context of what we'll be contributing to. It is my life's work and showcases tags that in name have not changed (`h-a-x` is still the same tag) but looks radically different over the years of interviews, talks, and late, late nights.

Write a blog post on dev.to with the following prompt:
- If you could build an app, website, or technology of any kind, What would it do?
- Who would it be for? How would they use it? How would you use it?
- If money was no concern, time no concern; what would you do with your life and the skills you've assembled if you could dedicate it to one thing?
Shoot for 400 words with this. This is not 2 paragraphs you can just lift from someone else; I want to know what motivates you and what you want to do in the world.
