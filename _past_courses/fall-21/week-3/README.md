# Week 3: What makes web components special?
## Tues: Critique and 4 APIs that make web components tick
- Short Lecture on what the 4 are with examples and my pitch for why they are future proof with lots of examples - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mQNGt0lLupWH8PmBMhS3wAyssZnV2jZpYoAZgWrKYWw/edit?usp=sharing
- Critique / open review of notable examples from the 1st code exercise
- Check Canvas for your group association if you don't already know who's in your group. Find and sit with these people (do this every class from now on)
## Thurs: Exploring other frameworks and getting team setup
- Group activity: We need exposure to other "component" concepts but we also need to make sure we're all on the same page in contributing this semester
 - Create a github organization (1 person run point on this) with a name you all agree on. Also create a logo / use some random icon / something to identify you.
 - Add all team members to the organization
 - Pick a team member to be the starting point for repo creation (it'll make life easier) call it like github.com/`yourname`/boilerplates or something
 - Have each member (including person who made the org) fork this repo to their own github account and clone THAT to their local machine
 - **Each group member will be responsible for making commits to THEIR clone of the repo, then Pull Requesting to merge them together**
 - *Each Group member* should create a folder for *one* of the following projects in their fork and get it committed
  - VueJS, Angular, React, StencilJS
  - Find a hello world style boilerplate for the project you selected (Google is your friend)
  - use yarn (or npm) to install the assets **inside of the fork of the repo**
  - Example directory structure you should have in the end after all teammates have code PR'ed together into 1 repo
```
/boilerplates/
/boilerplates/react-example
/boilerplates/angularBoiler
/boilerplates/VueJSGettingStarted
/boilerplates/StencilJS-hello
/boilerplates/README.md
```
### Tips
- If you don't have everyone here, contact your teammate and assign them 1 of the projects (or if a group of 2 only do 2 of them)
- have 1 person be a sort of "scrum master" that creates the initial org / repo that you all fork them (the scrum master also forks from the org repo)
- you should probably have a README and .gitignore in your shared repo that you all agree upon prior to forking
- have each teammate fork from the org's repo as the source of truth
- This forms a backdrop to make it easier for you to do the homework / blogging for the week
## Homework
- Read series: Let's Build web components (understanding the spec) - https://dev.to/bennypowers/lets-build-web-components-part-1-the-standards-3e85
 - This is a very well written deep dive that might be slightly out of date or need updating in areas but is very solid
- Read / Watch: moar-sarcasm plz: A tOtAlLy NeCeSsArY web components tutorial https://dev.to/btopro/moar-sarcasm-plz-a-totaly-necessary-web-components-tutorial-3c51
 - This is silly, but a very deep dive on APIs using VanillaJS
- Looking at the shared repo you built in class, install the different projects and look at the boilerplates for each
- Write a blog post on dev.to about this experience, answering these questions.
  - What commonalities are there between the boilerplate code?
  - What is duplicate / overlapping?
  - Which do you think is the easiest DX (Developer eXperience) to get going?
  - If starting to build an "app" tomorrow, which would you prefer and why?
  - Provide a links in your post to your organization as well as the repo that you got your boilerplate from
## Looking ahead
- Find a "CTA" or Call To Action button either in a specific framework or just the design comps / links where you'll look them up
- Next week we'll start into the process of designing, developing, publishing, building, testing, everything-ing; our own CTA
