# Week 14: Thanksgiving
- Nothing but tur-key tags

Nov 28th: check-in 3 due
- What your group got done since last check in (so last week + whenever else you work)
- What insights you gained from the class activity to implement
- What your next steps are?
- Your design should be taking shape
- Your logic layer should be starting to come together
- You should at least take a stab at modifying the haxProperties HAXSchema to map to your element and understand that relationship
- `TEAMNOTES.md` updated to reflect the above + code to actually back up that your not writing things like "we talked a bunch" as I read these and am not dumb.
