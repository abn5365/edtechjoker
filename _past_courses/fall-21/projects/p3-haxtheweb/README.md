# Project 3: HAX Our Web
We arrive at the activist goal of the course.. well... my goals anyway - To generate the next generation of potential contributors to HAX the web and the hope of shaping the future of content creation on the web. While our goals are lofty, never set bars so low you can step over them lest you grow complacent and old.

https://github.com/elmsln/project-3 is to be used as a boilerplate to jump start development / organizing again.
This has everything you need in a `rename-me` element. If you can't take the hint **you are to rename this across the entire project submission to make sense for your element**.

# Scope
Contribute to [HAX The Web](https://haxtheweb.org/) through a series of open ended issues and project requirements. While many of these issues will have overlap in scope (create a web component / series of web components) not all groups will get the same element. This is attempting to generate something generally to specification and generally looking and functioning the same way as a prototype.

This project is putting into practice what you've learned through out the semester. There will be limited training wheels as far as boilerplate code produced and the element requirements will be more reflective of a real working environment.

# Relevant code samples / projects to pull to dig into further
- [word-count](https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/word-count/word-count.js) - This knows how many words are in its slotted area and also has translation support for i18n
- [multiple-choice](https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/multiple-choice/multiple-choice.js) - a complex element that reads data in from its light dom to create an array. It knows what options exist as well as what the right vs wrong answer is. Also supplies HAX wiring via `haxProperties` callback
- [self-check](https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/self-check/self-check.js) - checking if you know the answer. Doesn't actually tell you right or wrong but does have states, click to reveal, simple colors, i18n, `haxProperties` and lazy loading integration.
- [retro-card](https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/retro-card/retro-card.js) - a uniquely designed card that has hover states and interesting haxProperties integration to do things like "tags"

# Background
[HAXTheWeb.org](https://haxtheweb.org/) is a moon shot by me and my team to change publishing and make the web a place that all people can be creative without needing to learn complex web or CMS technologies. Our "lego" approach is entirely built on web components to encompass everything from a small icon all the way up to a full CMS as a single web component (made up of 100s of others).

In order to compress 4 years of innovation and concepts down into ~5 hours, I've created a playlist of related things.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5d33apeMrh4LqD3i9QdB7Px
This starts with demonstrating very early versions of HAX and explaining it conceptually, moves into the keynote I gave at our 1st event, and then is a series of live streams and tutorials of concepts. It's important to watch these in order to have the correct mental model of what we're doing and how it works behind the scenes, just enough to envision how to integrate with it.

# What you'll do
- Working as a group, you'll select from a series of pre-approved issues in the HAXTheWeb issue queue. These issues are intended to be a reasonable 5 week scope of a project while still being challenging
- All of the web components we'll work on are a mix of visual and "stateful" components; meaning that the web component must have knowledge of the "state" of itself in some way. This could be simple like "I know my text value" or complex like "I know the score the user just got on that quiz question".
  - *If you like this project and are enrolled in my class next semester, this is the front-end piece that we'll wire to a backend in that course to make it a real micro-app that serves a dedicated, singular purpose.*
- Produce and distribute a project on NPM that is well documented / has a working demo, has basic tests, has a basic storybook, is well designed, is reusable, maintains statefulness, is flexible design wise via CSS and JS events, **and has built in wiring for HAXTheWeb to empower others**.

## Final / top prize(s)
Any elements that are of exceptional quality (or only needing minor tweaks for adoption) and get accepted into the HAXTheWeb portfolio of elements will get a üèí emoji implying that you get an official HAXTheWeb hockey jersey. If this is the case I'll contact your team during finals week. The hope is that these element will also start showing up in the course work of your peers, future verisons of you, or in your own courses in coming semesters. This project is gaining momentum and we pipeline these enhancements directly to Penn State students, faculty and staff via the https://hax.psu.edu SaaS solution.


# Issues to choose from
There will only be a maximum of 2 groups per element allowed. This gives you a group that you can bounce ideas off of directly as to how you're going to do the build out while still ensuring variety in what is produced. I will be refining the expectations / some direction on how I'd attack these in the issue in the queue over the next few days. If you have questions, start asking them on the issue itself (this is teasing out requirements from the user)

- `[mark-the-words] Marking defined words in a text area #882` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/882
- `[sorting-question] A question that requires the user sort the possible options #872` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/872
- `[flash-card] create a flash card for practicing comprehension in material #881` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/881
- `[event-badge] make a badge / "remixable" conference image for hax #607` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/607
- `[post-card] Make a remixable post card for hax #879` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/879
- `[trading-card] Trading cards are awesome, let's make some #880` https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/880

## Claiming an issue
You have github and this is an issue queue for a massive project. How would you claim a project and dig into it in the real world?

# Rubric
20% of course grade
- Final result matches the composite / issue selected, is polished, wired to HAX, and - 4%
- Issue specific requirements are satisfied in the design and implementation of the element - 10%
- A meaningful automated test for the element you produce - 1%
- A story that allows for leveraging properties - 1%
- Teamnotes maintained with status updates, on github, published to npm in the end - 4%

# Bonus oppurtunities
- If your element can benefit from i18n - implement internationalization support in your demo. This means setting the language to one other than english (page level) and then translate your element's textual areas to another language. +1% *per language you add, up to 3 languages* (though you'll need to add more demo pages to illustrate this or create a select box that changes the page's language)
- Add lazyloading support for all assets and the element itself +1%
More to be announced as we move forward

# Timeline
- 2.5 weeks before Thanksgiving break
- 2.5 weeks after Thanksgiving break
- Don't procrastinate.
- Each Check in I'll review repos for progress / questions
- Tuesday will be review of issues expressed / concepts we need to add in
- Thursday will be more open ended time to work in class and ask questions

## Check-ins
- Each Sunday at midnight there is a check-in on project status. This is why teamnotes above is listed as 4%. Each check-in will be worth 1%
- There will be a task each week. Hitting these milestones will help keep you on pace but also ensure we have things to discuss each class
- Much like project one, I'll be using your own examples to provide discussion and offer feedback throughout
- While visually different, many of the projects have overlapping needs.
- These check-ins and accomplishments for the week are to be documented in your TEAMNOTES.md file along with other meetings your group has

# Possible team break down
Each project will have multiple elements. You'll need to delegate in a way that makes sense relative to the previous two projects.

# Due Dates
- Nov 7th: check-in 1 due
  - Blog post 9 is also due Nov 7th
- Nov 14th: check-in 2 due
- Nov 28th: check-in 3 due
- Dec 5th: check-in 4 due
  - Blog post 10 is also due Dec 5th
- Dec 14th (Tuesday of finals week): Project is due by 11:59pm. This is turned into Canvas dropbox 1 per team
  - Link to your repo as well as npmjs.com published package just like you did in Project two
