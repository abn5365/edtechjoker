# Project 3 (30%) - Contributing to the open source fabric of the university (and beyond)

For this project, you'll be selecting a real issue from our project's issue queue of a pre-selected, well-scoped, able to be completed in the last month of the semester level project.

## For Context
- I've closed [888 issues in the last 3 years](https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues?q=assignee%3Abtopro+is%3Aopen)
- The work preceeding this had several thousand that I had closed and millions of lines of code written for it
- If I make things seem easy at times, it is this grind. I am you in 15 years if you keep at it and want it enough, nothing more.
- You will be grinding on a singular issue which is a real world problem / need we have
- If you find this work satisfying (broadly), get an A in this class and want to do more work like it in the future, I offer independent studies (3 credits, 10 hours a week work expectation, work on bigger problems / ideas)

## Project 3 high level requirements
- You are to select 1 of these projects to work on -- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- There are _individual requirements for each project_ and general high level requirements listed on this page.
- If there are unknowns, details should be teased out on discord or in the issue queue for this issue
- **This is an individual assignment. There are 5 projects, 53 in the class, that's ~10 solutions per project** 
  - We will get into larger groups in class to swap ideas and do reviews together
  - There will be a limit of 12 per project (or 6 pairs if you both want to work on it, **though the work is individual**)
  - Solutions within the larger group will be somewhat similar at times, this isn't a bad thing, but blatant copying is pretty obvious as I review and is unacceptable.

## Requirements regardless of project selection
- [ ] Small gist style check in weekly answering the following: What did you do? What do you need advisement on? Link to code repo for specific questions.
- [ ] Open-WC / Lit based, vercel as a stand alone demo but shown on an example page made
- [ ] **worked on and submitted individually**
- [ ] Create a group on Discord for your tag name. As I am the "client" for all 5 of these, make sure to ask questions of other people working on the problem 1st, THEN if it's a question of requirements / being lost, ask this question and @ me there.
- [ ] I will give specific feedback about specific problems and questions

## Rubric
- Does the project meet the requirements laid out in the specification for the project 27%
  - CSS, DESIGN based requirements met. Does it look like what was requested either exactly or as interpretted? 8%
  - Is it Accessible? Did it meet the accessibility requirements spelled out and does it have any obvious a11y errors? 4%
  - Did you implement the code that was asked to be reused (sub-class / superclass usage, elements from our library, JSON to load content [if requested] etc)? 5%
  - Did you implement the properties to make this truly reusable? Does it implement custom events correctly when logical? 5%
  - Is it using Vercel for the demo? Does the demo work? Does it meet requirements based on feedback and is it a complete working solution? 5%
- Small gist status checks. (Every Sunday, 3 of them) - 3%
