## Week 13 - Project 2 Due April 9th; begin scoping Project 3
### High Level how you should be approaching this
- Generally we want dumb components that are design oriented and smart components that bring them to life
- Badge element (visually)
- Badge List element (Array, map'ed and prints Badge element)
- Search element (visually)
- "app" element that listens to events on search (input), does the searching in `/api/search`, and then takes those results and prop drills them into the Badge List element (which then prints them out)
- Logic could happen in your `index.html` but might be easier to manage events in a `badge-app` level element so that top document is just `<badge-app>`

- example (Pull request) to get search to talk to the higher app -- https://github.com/AaronLobitana/badge-search/pull/1
